The Banking Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application that provides essential banking functionalities through a secure, modular, and file-driven approach. It is designed to streamline banking operations, ensure data integrity, and offer a user-friendly experience for both administrators and customers.

Key Features

Secure login authentication using username and password

View and search all customer records and profiles

Add new customer accounts and delete existing ones

Manage branch-specific data files for modular data control

2. Customer Management
Unique customer registration using CNIC, username, and password

Login with 14-digit account number and secure 8-digit PIN

Account blocking mechanism with penalty tracking for suspicious activity

Profile management (update address, phone number, etc.)

Repayment plan options: monthly, half-yearly, or yearly

Installment calculation and repayment history tracking

Penalty management and dynamic loan status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

6. Multi-Branch Support
Each branch operates on isolated data files for modular scalability

Files named by branch (e.g., admin_branch1.txt, customer_branch2.txt)

Easy to expand by adding new branches without altering core system logic

Supports future growth and system upgrades

7. File-Based Data Persistence
All data (users, accounts, loans, transactions) stored using Java file handling

Persistent storage ensures data is saved and reloaded between sessions

No database dependencyâ€”ideal for lightweight setups

Improves ease of debugging, backup, and unit testing

PIN validation enforces length and numeric structure

Suspicious activity or penalty violations trigger account blocking

9. Console-Based User Interface
Text-based menu system with clear navigation

Separate menu flows for Admin and Customer roles

Easy-to-understand prompts and error messages

Robust input validation using loops and exception handling

Technologies Used
